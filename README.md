 Why Lebron is the goat

  <h1>Longevity</h1>
  <div id="He's 40">
    <p>Lebron is 40. he's been doing this for 21 whole seasons. He has been averaging over 20 points per game for the past 21 years. I don't see mj doing that. Nobody has been able to maintain themself like lebron which is why he is the goat. Just look at his glory below. </p>

  <h2>40 years? 40k points</h2>
    <p>Not only is he 40 years old, he has the most points ever scored which is over 40k. This is some goat level stuff ain't no one breaking this for a while. Look at this link that highlights how great he is.</p>

   <h3>Why isn't mj as good as bron?</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Played in an easy era</li>
    <li>Didn't have nearly as much longevity</li>
    <li>Isn't as well rounded, bulls were still good during his 3 year hiatus</li>
   </ol>
